                        she's cosmopolitan. Fine, fresh, fierce, we got it on lock. Never planned that one day I'd be
                        losing you. She eats your heart out. Your kiss is cosmic, every move is magic. I mean the ones,
                        I
                        mean like she's the one. Greetings loved ones let's take a journey. Just own the night like the
                        4th of July! But you'd rather get wasted.</p>
                    <h4 id="features">@features</h4>
                    <p>Placeholder content for the scrollspy example. 'Cause she's the muse and the artist. (This is how
                        we do) So you wanna play with magic. So just be sure before you give it all to me. I'm walking,
                        I'm walking on air (tonight). Skip the talk, heard it all, time to walk the walk.</p>

                        that one international smile. There's a stranger in my bed, there's a pounding in my head. Oh,
                        no. In another life I would make you stay. ‘Cause I, I’m capable of anything. Suiting up for my
                        crowning battle. Used to steal your parents' liquor and climb to the roof. Tone, tan fit and
                        ready, turn it up cause its gettin' heavy. Her love is like a drug. I guess that I forgot I had
                        a
                        choice.</p>
                    <h4 id="two">two</h4>

                        walking, I'm walking on air (tonight). Yeah, we maxed our credit cards and got kicked out of the
                        bar. Yo, shout out to all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money. I'm ma get your
                        heart racing in my skin-tight jeans. If you get the chance you better keep her. Yo, shout out to
                        all you kids, buying bottle service, with your rent money.</p>
                    <h4 id="three">three</h4>

                        your
                        birthday suit. The one that got away. Last Friday night, yeah I think we broke the law, always
                        say we're gonna stop. 'Cause she's a little bit of Yoko, And she's a little bit of 'Oh no'. I
                        want the jaw droppin', eye poppin', head turnin', body shockin'. Yeah, we maxed our credit cards
                        and got kicked out of the bar.</p>
